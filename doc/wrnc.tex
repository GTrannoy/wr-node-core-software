\section{Introduction}
This is the manual of the driver and the library for the
\textit{White-Rabbit Node-Core} HDL core developed on the \textbf{Open
  HardWare Repository}\footnote{http://www.ohwr.org/projects/wr-node-core-sw}

The goal of this manual is to explain you how to retrieve, install
and using the software. This manual does not explain details about
the White-Rabbit Node-Core or its internal behavior. If you want to
know more about the White-Rabbit Node-Core, please refer to the HDL
documentation.

Here you will not find the API details. For API documentation,
generate the Doxygen documentation by running the following command:

\begin{verbatim}
  cd doc
  make doxygen
\end{verbatim}

The HTML documentation will be available in the directory
\texttt{doxy-wrnc}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Repository}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This project is hosted on the Open HardWare Repository at the
following link \url{http://www.ohwr.org/projects/wr-node-core-sw}

You can get the git repository using the following command:
\begin{verbatim}
  git clone --recursive
     git://ohwr.org/white-rabbit/wr-node-core/wr-node-core-sw.git
\end{verbatim}

The repository is organized as following:
\begin{description}
  \item[kernel] this directory contains all the driver's source files
  \item[lib] this directory contains all the library source files
  \item[tools] this directory contains the sources for a set of simple
    tools.
  \item[applications] this directory contains a collection of
    applications where the White-Rabbit Node-Core is involved. Each
    application is documented separately
  \item[doc] this directory contains all the documentation of this
    project. Here, you can generate the doxygen documentation of the
    library and this manual as well.
\end{description}


\subsection{Dependencies}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
All the software dependencies are part of the repository as git
sub-modules. The driver depends on the
\texttt{fmc-bus}\footnote{\url{http://www.ohwr.org/projects/fmc-bus}},
so you can find its git sub-module in the repository.

There is also a \texttt{svec-sw} sub-module. This is not a real
dependency but the SVEC is where probably you are going to use the
White-Rabbit Node-Core. This facilitate the package release and
distribution. It also allows us to give an indication about the
carrier compatibility.

Remember to use the \texttt{--recursive} option in order to clone also
all sub-modules

\begin{verbatim}
  git clone --recursive <repo-address>
\end{verbatim}

If you did not clone with the \texttt{--recursive} option, then update
the sub-modules with the following command

\begin{verbatim}
  git submodule update
\end{verbatim}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Installation}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The driver depends on the \texttt{fmc-bus} driver, as well as the
Linux kernel. Also, it must talk to a specific FPGA binary with the
(White-Rabbit Node-Core inside) running in the carrier card. According
to the \texttt{fmc-bus} module, you have also to load the driver of
your carrier (\texttt{svec-sw} or \texttt{spec-sw})

The library does not have any dependency with other software packages.

\subsection{Gateware Installation}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The White-Rabbit Node-Core is an HDL component; so, there is not
a dedicated gateware, but it can be part of any gateware. These
gatewares must be placed under \texttt{/lib/firmware} and loaded with
other fmc's drivers.
%FIXME it will change with UAL

\subsection{Software Installation}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Compilation}
There are not special requirements for the compilation, just run

\begin{verbatim}
  make
\end{verbatim}

Optionally, you can set the following environment variables to
customize you compilation:
\begin{description}
  \item[LINUX] path to a \textit{Linux} source directory
  \item[FMC\_BUS] path to a \textit{fmc-bus} directory
\end{description}

In order to compile for different environments, in the directories
\texttt{lib} and \texttt{tools} you can create a dedicated
\texttt{Makefile} to configure the environment before run the
project's \texttt{Makefile}. This dedicated \texttt{Makefile} must be
named \texttt{Makefile.specific}.

The compilation will produce the binary files in the respective
directories.

Note that the compilation process will also compile all the
applications under the directory \texttt{applications}.

\subsubsection{Library and Tools Installation}
Once you have compiled the library and tools you can install the
binaries in order to make them visible to the entire system.

\begin{verbatim}
  make install
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Driver Loading}
You can place the driver wherever you want and load it using
\texttt{modporbe(8)} or \texttt{insmod(8)}.

The driver support the following module parameters:
\begin{description}
  \item[max\_slot\_msg] Maximum number of messages to keep in the
    driver internal queue for each slot.
  \item[sync\_timeout] Maximum number of milli-seconds to wait for a
    synchronous answer.
\end{description}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Software Usage}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In figure~\ref{fig:swgenstack} you can see an overview of the software
stack and the White-Rabbit Node-Core internal components seen by the
driver.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{img/sw-gen-stack.eps}
	\caption{White-Rabbit Node-Core Software Stack}
        \label{fig:swgenstack}
\end{figure}

Looking from the bottom to the top. The final user-space program has
three way to access the White-Rabbit Node-Core resources:

\begin{itemize}
  \item the application specific library. It is suggested to use these
    libraries for application-specific programs. Note that this kind of
    libraries may hide White-Rabbit Node-Core details/architecture.
  \item the White-Rabbit Node-Core library \texttt{libwrnc}. It can be
    used at any time when the specific library does not provide all
    functionality.
  \item the driver's sysfs attributes and char devices
\end{itemize}

From the figure \ref{fig:swgenstack} is clear that the only way to
communicate with the White-Rabbit Node-Core is through its Linux
driver; there are not other ways to access it.


\subsection{Library Interface}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
More details about the White-Rabbit Node-Core library API are
available through the doxygen documentation. To build the doxygen
documentation, run the following commands:

\begin{verbatim}
  cd doc
  make
\end{verbatim}

You will find the HTML documentation in the doxy-wrnc directory. Each
application should provide its own library and relative doxygen
documentation. For each application you should find a \texttt{doc}
directory where you can build the doxygen documentation or any other
kind of documentation.


\subsection{Driver Interface}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The driver is the only software component in the stack that can access
the White-Rabbit Node-Core component on the FPGA. The White-Rabbit
Node-Core exports two communication channels: Host-Message-Queue and
the Shared-Memory. These communication channels are used to communicate
between a real-time application, running on the
CPU\footnote{Internally, the White-Rabbit Node-Core has up to 8 CPUs.
Each CPU runs, independently, a real-time application.}, and the Linux
driver.

The device hierarchy of the driver is shown in figure 
\ref{fig:swdrvhier}; there is a main device and then sub-devices 
according to the White-Rabbit Node-Core configuration.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{img/sw-drv-hier.eps}
	\caption{White-Rabbit Node-Core Device Driver Hierarchy}
        \label{fig:swdrvhier}
\end{figure}

The Linux device driver export three interfaces: sysfs attributes,
char-devices and debugfs.

\subsubsection{Debugfs Interface}
The purpose of the \textit{debugfs} is to provide debuggin information.
Usually, the debugfs file-system is not automatically mounted. If it
is not, mount it by using the following command:

\begin{verbatim}
    mount -t debugfs none /sys/kernel/debug
\end{verbatim}

In this directory you will find a directory for each WRNC loaded. These
directories have this format: \textbf{'wrnc-\%04x', device\_id}.

Following the list of the available debug files:
\begin{description}
  \item['wrnc-\%04x-cpu-\%02d-dbg', device\_id, cpu\_index]. For each
CPU we have a debugfs file. By reading the debugfs file you can
read the debug messages coming from the real-time application.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Char-Devices Interface}
All char-devices are available under the directory \texttt{/dev/}.

\begin{description}
 \item['wrnc-\%04x', device\_id] it refers to the entire device 
(\texttt{\%04x = device\_id}). It supports\texttt{read}, 
\texttt{write}, \texttt{seek} and \texttt{ioctl}. It allows users to 
read/write the internal shared memory.
 
 \item['wrnc-\%04x-cpu-\%02d', device\_id, cpu\_index] it refers to a 
single CPU in the
 White-Rabbit Node-Core. It supports \texttt{read}, \texttt{write} and 
\texttt{seek}. It allows users to load or to dump CPU firmware.
 
 \item['wrnc-\%04x-hmq-\%c-\%02d', device\_id, direction, hmq\_index] 
it refers to a single HMQ slot in
the White-Rabbit Node-Core. Slot are splitted in two category: input 
slots (\texttt{\%c = 'i'}) and output slots (\texttt{\%c = 'o'}). It 
supports \texttt{read}\footnote{on output slots}, 
\texttt{write}\footnote{on input slots}, \texttt{seek} and 
\texttt{poll}
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Sysfs Interface}
You can find all the sysfs attributes under the directory 
\texttt{/sys/class/wr-node-core/}. Following a table of all sysfs 
attributes available.

\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.8}
\begin{tabular}{c c c p{6cm}}
  device & name & direction & description \\

\hline
  wrnc & application\_id & RO & application identifier of the WRNC 
bitstream \\

\hline
  wrnc & n\_cpu & RO & get the number of CPUs \\

\hline
  wrnc & enable\_mask & RW & it enable/disable CPUs. It's a bit mask. 
Actually, it means that it runs or pauses the code  \\

\hline
  wrnc & reset\_mask & RW & it (de-)assert the CPUs' reset line. It's 
a bit mask \\

\hline
  wrnc & smem\_operation & RW & it set the default operation modo for 
te access to the shared memory \\

\hline \hline

  cpu & enable & RW & it enable/disable a CPU. Actually, it means 
that it runs or pauses the code \\

\hline
  cpu & reset & RW & it (de-)assert the CPU reset line \\

\hline \hline

  hmq & count & RO & number of messages in the HMQ slot \\

\hline
  hmq & empty & RO & the hardware status of the HMQ slot is empty \\

\hline
  hmq & full & RO & the hardware status of the HMQ slot is full \\

\end{tabular}


\subsubsection{Load Real-Time Programs}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Without applications the White-Rabbit Node-Core does nothing. So, to
make it productive we must load a real-time application on the CPU.

For this purpose the driver offers a dedicated char device for each
CPU that allows you to load (dump) application to (from) the CPU
memory.

You can find these char-devices under the directory \texttt{/dev/} 
with the following patter \textit{wrnc-\%04x-cpu-\%02d}.

You can load an application by writing to the char device. You can
dump an application by reading from the char device. With
\texttt{lseek(2)} or \texttt{fseek(2)} you can point to different
a memory offset.

The library provides dedicated functions for these operations.


\subsubsection{Host Message Queue}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This is the main communication channel between the software and the
hardware. The Host-Message-Queue has up to 32 slots. The slots are
mono-directional, so there are up to 16 input slots and up to 16
output slots.

The driver exports these slots as char-devices. By reading/writing
from/to these char-devices you can send/receive messages. Obviously,
the content of the message depends on the application running on the
White-Rabbit Node-Core CPUs.

You can find these char-devices under the directory \texttt{/dev/}, 
with following patter \textit{wrnc-\%04x-hmq-\%c-\%02d}.

Here the data structures\footnote{read the doxygen 
documentation for details} involved in the communication:

\begin{lstlisting}
struct wrnc_msg {
	uint32_t datalen;
	uint32_t data[WRNC_MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE];
};

struct wrnc_msg_sync {
  struct wrnc_msg msg;
  uint16_t index_in;
  uint16_t index_out;
  unsigned int timeout_ms;
};
\end{lstlisting}

The slot's char-devices have also \texttt{ioctl(2)} capabilities:
\begin{description}
  \item[msg\_sync] allow to send a message and receive an answer
    synchronously. The ioctl command is \texttt{WRNC\_IOCTL\_MSG\_SYNC}
    and it accepts \texttt{struct wrnc\_msg\_sync} as argument. The
    message sent will be overwritten by the answer.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Shared Memory}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The Shared-Memory is a secondary way to communicate with the real-time
applications running on the White-Rabbit Node-Core. The driver exports
this communication channel through a char device. With \texttt{lseek(2)}
or \texttt{fseek(2)} the char-device you can point to a specific
memory offset.

The size of this Shared-Memory is 8192 bytes. The Shared-Memory
address space is divided by ranges; each range has an associated write
operation. The first offset range from 0 to 8192 allows you to
directly access the Shared-Memory without any operation. All the other
ranges perform atomic operations; the write operation is always
executed by using as argument the current content of the memory cell:

\begin{math}
  cell = cell \left\{ \vee, \wedge, +, \dots \right\} value
\end{math}

To keep consistency between documentations, please, refer to the HDL 
documentation for details about ranges and operations.

You can find these char-devices under \texttt{/dev/} with the
following name patter \textit{wrnc-\%04x}.

The default operation of the char-device is a direct access to the 
memory. You can change the default behaviour of the char-device by 
writing on the sysfs attribute \texttt{smem\_operation}
\footnote{\texttt{/sys/class/wr-node-core/wrnc-\%04x/smem\_operation}}
 

The char-devices have also \texttt{ioctl(2)} capabilities:
\begin{description}
  \item[smem\_io] allow to read/write a memory cell. The ioctl command
    is \texttt{WRNC\_IOCTL\_SMEM\_IO} and it accepts \texttt{struct
    wrnc\_smem\_io} as argument. In case of write operation the
    value will be overwritten with the result of the write operation.
\end{description}

Here the data structures\footnote{read the doxygen documentation for 
details} involved in the communication using
\texttt{ioctl(2)}:

\begin{lstlisting}
struct wrnc_smem_io {
	uint32_t addr;
	uint32_t value;
	int is_input;
	enum wrnc_smem_modifier mod;
};
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Debug Real-Time Application}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Real-Time applications are able to send debug messages to the user
through the driver. The driver export a \textit{debugfs} char device
that allow you to read messages coming from a specific Real-Time
application running on a CPU. On this char-device you can only
\texttt{read(2)} and \texttt{poll(2)}. Data coming from this char-device
are simple characters' string \texttt{NULL} terminated. In order words,
the Real-Time application does \texttt{printf} and you can read the
string printed by the application.

You can find the char device in the \textit{debugfs} under the path:
\begin{verbatim}
/sys/kernel/debug/wrnc-%04x/wrnc-%04x-cpu-%02d-dbg
\end{verbatim}

Rembember that the \textit{debugfs} usually is not auto-mounted. In
order to mount \textit{debugfs}:

\begin{verbatim}
mount -t debugfs none /sys/kernel/debug/
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Tools}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Under the directory \texttt{tools} you can find the following
programs:

\begin{description}
  \item[lswrnc] it shows the available White-Rabbit Node-Core
  \item[wrnc-count] it returns the number of available White-Rabbit
    Node-Core
  \item[wrnc-messages] it dumps messages from an output slot
  \item[wrnc-smem] it reads/writes on the shared memory
  \item[wrnc-cpu-restart] it restarts CPUs
  \item[wrnc-loader] it loads/dumps application to/from the CPU memory
\end{description}

All these tools use the \texttt{libwrnc} library, so they are good
example of the API usage.

Each tool has an internal help page accessible using the
command line option \texttt{-h}. Please use this help. We are not
providing information here in order to avoid inconsistencies.

\section{Bugs and Missing Features}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize}
  \item Reading a slot is an exclusive operation. More threads cannot
    read the same message from the same slot. (It will be implemented
    later)
  \item filtering messages is not possible yet
\end{itemize}
